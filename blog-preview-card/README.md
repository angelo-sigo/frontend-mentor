## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
  - Semantic tags
- CSS3
  - BEM CSS
  - CSS variables
  - Mobile first design

### What I learned

In this project I could practice very precious soft skills. To contextualize, I'm a very perfectionist person and this disturb me in a very negative way. Due my little defect I suffer something called [*Analysis Paralysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis), and this project was a great opportunity to treat this. After several days working on it, I've decided to follow the phrase "Done is better than perfect". It's not too easy as it seems, but with this thought I was able to finish the challenge, for now. To deliver this project I've used the following technics:

- Mobile First Design
- Minimal Viable Product Development

### Continuous development

To proceeding  with the development, I've establish the following goals:

- [ ] Make the entire page responsive
- [ ] Update the architecture with React components and CSS preprocessors (like SASS)
- [ ] Add error pages
- [ ] Add some cool feature (maybe a CRUD) with JS
- [ ] BONUS: Learn TypeScript.
