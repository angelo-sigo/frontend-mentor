## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
  - Semantic tags
  - Google Fonts CDN
  - BEM CSS
- CSS3
  - Flexbox design
  - CSS variables

### What I learned

In this project I didn't put into practice any concepts that were particularly new to me. However, I was able to take the opportunity to recall old knowledge, such as semantic HTML and responsive design with flexbox.

### Continuous development

In the near future, I plan to implement component modularization in this project using `React.js` with `Node.js` and CSS preprocessors such as `SASS`.
