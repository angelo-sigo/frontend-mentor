## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
  - Semantic tags
- CSS3
  - Flexbox layout
  - Variables
  - Animations

### What I learned

Hi everyone, how's it going? In this challenge, I tried to apply the concept of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as much as possible and the technique of designing for mobile devices first (Mobile-First). I'm proud of the final result for a first solution with the minimum features, and I hope to keep improving the code.

### Continuous development

To continue the development, I plan to add keyboard navigation for the links, as well as refactor the CSS code to improve readability.
